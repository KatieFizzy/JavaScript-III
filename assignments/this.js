/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Object Binding - if "this" is used while in global scope, it will bind to the window object;
* 2. Implicit Binding -used when referring to a property within an object, the word this followed by .

the format of a new binding tells the parameters to attach in the new object being created from the constructor
* 4. Explicit binding -
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
